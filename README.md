Specializing in problem solving and their techniques. 

New problems to identify and test them have always interested me and I am always on the lookout for it. 
  
I have practiced advanced manual testing practices and am well versed in not only following them but also creating and establishing QA practices in projects. From Test Planning, Test Case Writing, - Test Prioritization, Defect Identification, Defect Priority, Root Cause Analysis to Sprint Retrospective, I have been an active participant in all. 

Along with QA related activities, I have been an active part of Sprint Planning, by playing the role of a Product Owner on a project. So defining of acceptance criteria, setting expectations for the - project is something I have a good hold on. 

I have been a core member, who started the development of Automation Framework in projects for various types of applications. These frameworks are being used to design automated test cases. I've used - Java, Selenium WebDriver, Cucumber, SQL, AWS IoT Manager to design these frameworks and test cases for Web and IoT based applications. 

Performance testing is also a field that interests me, and have actively studying and learned about it, to advance myself in it. 
  
I believe that along with being updated with technological advances like automating test cases, core values of testing should not be forgotten.
